# Sign-In Redirect Fix Test Guide

## Fix Summary
The signin redirect issue has been fixed by updating the login function in `/cw_dashboard/src/contexts/UserfrontAuthContext.tsx` to handle different response formats from Userfront, particularly in test mode.

## Changes Made
1. **Enhanced Login Response Handling**: Added comprehensive logging and multiple checks for successful authentication
2. **Session Establishment Delays**: Added delays to allow Userfront to establish the session before redirecting
3. **Retry Logic**: Added retry logic with longer delays if the session is not immediately established
4. **Better Error Messages**: Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Fallback Authentication Check**: Added checks for `window.Userfront?.user?.userId` to catch successful authentications that might have unexpected response formats

## Test Steps
1. **Access the application**: http://localhost:13001
2. **Navigate to Sign In**: You should be redirected to `/auth/signin` if not authenticated
3. **Enter credentials**: Use valid email and password
4. **Click "Sign in"**: The authentication should process
5. **Verify redirect**: You should be automatically redirected to the home page (`/`) after successful signin

## Expected Console Logs
When signing in successfully, you should see these logs in the browser console:
- `[UserfrontAuth] Login attempt for: [email]`
- `[UserfrontAuth] Login response received: [response details]`
- One of:
  - `[UserfrontAuth] Login successful with immediate access, redirecting to dashboard`
  - `[UserfrontAuth] Login successful, setting up user session...`
  - `[UserfrontAuth] User authenticated after login, redirecting to home`

## Troubleshooting
If the redirect doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Look for the `[UserfrontAuth]` prefixed logs to understand the flow
3. Verify that the user is actually authenticated by checking `window.Userfront.user` in the console
4. Clear browser cookies/localStorage and try again

## Implementation Details
The fix follows the same pattern as the registration fix:
- Handles Userfront test mode responses that may not include immediate tokens
- Adds session establishment delays to account for async operations
- Checks multiple indicators of successful authentication (userId, userUuid, tokens)
- Implements proper error handling with fallback checks
